          I write historical fiction with a passion, and eagerly read everything from fantasy to literature. Born and raised in the San Francisco Bay Area, I'm an avid traveler and backpacker, particularly in Europe and North America. I earned my BA and MA from Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo, where I also met my beautiful wife. By day, I work as a Technical Writer, having spent much of my career at places like Google and Facebook. In addition to writing novels, I also write short fiction online. When not reading or writing, I'm probably listening to U2, sailing my dadâ€™s boat, or gardening with my family.

          My debut novel, Between Two Fires, is being published by Thomas Dunne Books (an imprint of St. Martin's Press and Macmillan). It is the first in a series of historical fiction novels set in medieval Wales.
